A simple calculator made using ReactJS without using pre-built mathematical library.

I made this simple arithmetic calculator in ReactJS and will and more functionality in the future, probably some trigonometric functions and integrals.

I deployed this on vercel and here is the domain [Calculator](https://calculator-theta-beryl.vercel.app/).

Here is the image of the calculator(will change the UI too).
